# IsoGame \[asm\]
This project is about re-creating a rendering demo I made in Java where I rendered an isometric level with software rendering.

With this project, I'm working in x64 Assembly under windows.

In order to build you would need Visual Studio 2022 installed (others may be compatible), then open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` and navigate to the repository directory. Then run `build.bat` to build and `run.bat` to run.

I can't guarantee it will work flawlessly, this is merely a backup of my code.

Enjoy.
